# Virtual Display Driver
Based on Microsoft Indirect Display Driver Sample. This creates a virtual display in Windows that acts and functions just like a real one. It's useful for streaming, virtual reality applications, recording, headless servers, etc. The benefit over a physical display is the ability to adjust resolutions and refresh rates beyond the physical displays capabilities. For example, this would enable the ability to stream a game from your home PC using game streaming software at 240hz at 8K while owning a 60hz 1080p monitor (unrealistic, but explains the abilities well). For servers without displays, this enabled remote desktop and screen streaming to other systems as if there were a display installed. 

Supports emulating resolutions from **640 x 480** to **7680 x 4320 (8K)**, and refresh rates including **60hz, 75hz, 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 165hz, 240hz, 480hz,** and **500hz.**

This project uses the official Windows Indirect Display Driver combined with the IddCx class extension driver.
