# Virtual Display Driver
This creates a virtual display in Windows that acts and functions just like a real one. It's useful for streaming, virtual reality applications, recording, headless servers, etc. The benefit over a physical display is the ability to adjust resolutions and refresh rates beyond the physical displays capabilities. For example, this would enable the ability to stream a game from your home PC using game streaming software at 240hz at 8K while owning a 60hz 1080p monitor (unrealistic, but explains the abilities well). For servers without displays, this enabled remote desktop and screen streaming to other systems as if there were a display installed. 

Supports emulating resolutions from **640 x 480** to **7680 x 4320 (8K)**, and refresh rates including **60hz, 75hz, 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 165hz, 240hz, 480hz,** and **500hz.**

This project uses the official Windows Indirect Display Driver combined with the IddCx class extension driver.

## Download Stable Version

- [Universal Driver (Windows 10/11)]() - New installer and officially signed driver.

## EDID Database
- [EDID Database by Bud3699](https://edid.mikethetech.com/)

  You can use this database to load custom edid's into the driver! Or just general edid usage :) 

## Installation

- Step 1: Download the Installer
   - You can download the insaller directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/VirtualDisplay/Virtual-Display-Driver/releases) page.

- Step 2: Run the Installer
   - Download and run the installer.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

- Step 3: Verify the Installation
   - Check if the Virtual Display Driver is correctly installed by running the following:
