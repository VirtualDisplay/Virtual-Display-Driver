# Virtual Display Driver
Based on Microsoft Indirect Display Driver Sample. This creates a virtual display in Windows that acts and functions just like a real one. It's useful for streaming, virtual reality applications, recording, headless servers, etc. The benefit over a physical display is the ability to adjust resolutions and refresh rates beyond the physical displays capabilities. For example, this would enable the ability to stream a game from your home PC using game streaming software at 240hz at 8K while owning a 60hz 1080p monitor (unrealistic, but explains the abilities well). For servers without displays, this enabled remote desktop and screen streaming to other systems as if there were a display installed. 

Supports emulating resolutions from **640 x 480** to **7680 x 4320 (8K)**, and refresh rates including **60hz, 75hz, 90hz, 120hz, 144hz, 165hz, 240hz, 480hz,** and **500hz.**

This project uses the official Windows Indirect Display Driver combined with the IddCx class extension driver.

## Installation

### Release Instructions

1. Download the latest version from the above or the website, and extract the contents to a folder.
2. Copy the `\IddSampleDriver\` folder and its contents to `C:\IddSampleDriver\` before installing the driver **(important!)**.
3. Right click and run the *.bat file **as an Administrator** to add the driver certificate as a trusted root certificate.
4. Don't install the inf. Open device manager, click on any device, then click on the "Action" menu and click "Add Legacy Hardware".
5. Select "Add hardware from a list (Advanced)" and then select Display adapters.
6. Click "Have Disk..." and click the "Browse..." button. Navigate to the extracted files and select the inf file.
7. You are done! Go to display settings to customize the resolution of the additional displays. These displays show up in Sunshine, your Oculus or VR settings, and should be able to be streamed from.
8. You can enable/disable the display adapter to toggle the monitors.

**Ps.** Make sure that `options.txt` is accessible for the system at `C:\IddSampleDriver\options.txt` or the installation will fail.
